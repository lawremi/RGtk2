TODO for RELEASE
----------------

NAMESPACE should include:
Any case of gtk, pango, atk, glade, gdk, g as prefices followed by a capital letter
Operators: [, $, |, &, !
iWidget stuff
Old RGtk functions
names.GObject

NAMESPACE should NOT include:
The coercion (as.) methods (invoked implicitly)
*GetType() methods (express type as string)
gObjectGetClasses gObjectGetInterfaces gObjectGetProps
gObjectSetProps gObjectType gObjectTypeName gTypeGetSignal

Some current issues (bugs?) with RGtk2
----------

Specifics
---------

- atkStreamableContentGetStream: need to map GIOChannel to R connection
- implement GdkPixbufSaveFunc, cairo_read_t/write_t using R connections
- these functions SHOULD free a string parameter by ref: (but they don't)
	pango_parse_markup, gtk_im_context_get_(preedit_string/surrounding), gtk_widget_(class)_path
----> Wait introspection support
- CTREE_NODE_NEXT and CTREE_NODE_PREV are missing
- Problem with "destroy with parent" dialog that is explicitly destroyed
	  
General
---------

Easy Fixes:
-----------
guchar * data should go to raw vector
support translation of messages

Tough Fixes (questionable worth)
-----------
- GTK property parsing - needs better GParamSpec support, manual GValue initialization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
- Should the user be able to set fields on structures?
--- We would have to know whether or not the fields were "read only"
- What about macros?
--- Should make defs for them if they are truly necessary or greatly enhance convenience

GTK 2.10 changes
----------------
`-> Creating explicit bindings at runtime would be impractical
`-> Cairo and probably GtkMozEmbed would not support introspection 
	`-> Should cairo be made a separate package? - It has little utility outside of GTK
	`-> GtkMozEmbed could be a separate package, but it's not convenient
`-> Syntax tricks like the '$' and '[' operators could allow us to bind to 
	methods and fields at runtime
	`-> What about constructors? Need a "gNew" function?
	`-> What about ordinary functions - relatively few in number, 
		could be explicitly bound at runtime
`-> I think that, in general, we could generate some R bindings at build time,
	then have those tied into the type libraries on the C side, thus there are
	no compilation requirements on a certain GTK version.
		
Unsupported funcs
-----------------
Use the following code, with RGtk2 and your favorite "defs" loaded to find undefined
R functions:

invisible(sapply(names(defs$functions), function(name) { rName <- toCapPhraseName(name, TRUE, names(defs$objects)); if (!exists(rName)) print(rName) }))

[2] "gtkAccelGroupQuery"
[3] "gtkCListSetCompareFunc"
[1] "gtkContainerChildSetValist"
[1] "gtkContainerChildGetValist"
[3] "gtkCTreeSetDragCompareFunc"
[2] "gtkItemFactoryCreateMenuEntries"
[1] "gtkListStoreSetValist"
[3] "gtkSettingsInstallPropertyParser"
[1] "gtkTreeModelGetValist"
[1] "gtkTreeStoreSetValist"
[2] "gtkWidgetDestroyed"
[3] "gtkWidgetClassInstallStylePropertyParser"
[1] "gtkWidgetStyleGetValist"
[2] "gdkDisplaySetPointerHooks"
[2] "gdkDeviceFreeHistory"
[3] "gdkSetPointerHooks"
[3] "atkComponentAddFocusHandler"
[3] "atkObjectConnectPropertyChangeHandler"
[3] "atkAddFocusTracker"
[2] "atkFocusTrackerInit"
[3] "atkAddGlobalEventListener"
[2] "pangoFontDescriptionsFree"
[2] "pangoFontMapGetShapeEngineType"
[2] "pangoFontsetSimpleAppend"
[2] "pangoFontsetSimpleSize"
[2] "pangoReorderItems"

These 25 functions fall into 3 categories:
1) va_list (6): RGtk2 has no use for the functions taking va_list. Never supported.
2) undocumented/extremely low-level (10): The R programmer should not need these things. Never supported.
3) callbacks sans user data (9): need to record callbacks in an attribute on the R object then have
	one closure that calls the rest or if the callback scope is a function call something similar
	could be done as long as the calls aren't nested... May be supported.

- there are three categories of unsupported user functions (* will not be supported):
	1) No GType for a structure:
		This may be resolved when GLib introspection arrives. They need everything with GTypes.
		A lot of times this just requires a cast by the user. We could wrap these with R closures.
	2) Arrays as parameters:
		While it would be possible to create GValues holding arrays, it wouldn't be feasible
		with large arrays of primitives (like raw data). This one, and the one above,
		are related and could be solved by implementing everything outside of the GClosure system.
	3) Need to return a value by reference:
		The user function would be asked to return a list with those fields. This is doable manually.

	[1] GtkAccelGroupFindFunc: need to manually cast "key" and "closure" is just a pointer (still useable)
	[2] GtkClipboardTargetsReceivedFunc: only clipboard (and userdata) are valid, but the rest may be 
		retrieved with gtkClipboardWaitForTargets()
	[*] GtkCTreeGNodeFunc: This wouldn't be useful anyway due to lack of "GNode" objects in R...
		But still, you just have to manually cast the GNode and then well.. use it somehow..
		Note that the entire CTree widget is deprecated and this is a very obscure feature for it...
	[1] GtkFileFilterFunc: You'll need to manually cast "filter_info"
	[1] GtkKeySnoopFunc: Need to cast "event"
	[3] GtkMenuPositionFunc: This needs to be manually implemented so that the "x", "y", and "push_in" can be returned
	[2,3] GdkPixbufSaveFunc: This can't return an error.. we *could* manually implement this to allow error returning
	[*] GdkFilterFunc: The user will have to cast "xevent" to the native event type and then somehow use it...
		this would require supplemental C code for handling native events.. not likely it would be used
	[1] AtkKeySnoopFunc: Need to cast "event"
	[3] cairo_read_func_t: Needs manual implementation to return read data
	[2] cairo_write_func_t: Cannot convert array of data to write
	
	In my opinion, these are either not of much use or take just a little effort to use.
	Why maintain more code? Many of these would be very slow, like reading and writing of data
	and file filtering. Some seem almost useless (GtkMenuPositionFunc) while the rest
	are of some use but have simple workarounds (casting, calling some other function, etc).
	
Problems with defs files (as provided by pygtk)
--------------------
- GtkFileInfo/GtkFileSystem etc are not public
- gtk_init_abi_* is not part of the public api
- gtk_ctree_base_nodes has been removed from gtk
- gtk_icon_view_new_with_model should be marked as constructor
- gdk_color_new, gdk_rectangle_new, gdk_pixbuf_new_from_array are not actual functions
- In my opinion, gdk_atom_name is a function not a method, GdkAtom is not an object
- Also, GdkRectangle is not an object and so should not have methods
- gdk_pixbuf_get_from_drawable/image - should be functions not methods
- GtkBindingSet, though in the API docs, is not documented, and seems internal
- gtk_drag_get_souce_widget is in gdk.defs, but I feel that it belongs in gtk.defs
- GtkPrivateFlags is not documented and sounds, well, private
- Lots of strange deprecated duplicates that we need to filter out
- Features added to pygtk (compliant to specs): in/out params, user functions, enum/flag values
- Hacked some type names, like G(S)List[type] to specify the component type and [] indicating array
- gdk_pixbuf_save_to_buffer is missing
- THERES A LOT MORE MISSING
